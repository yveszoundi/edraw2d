#+TITLE: README

* What is this?

It's a simple utility to compute a list of points between a source and a destination ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_shortest_path][Euclidean shortest path]]). It bundles a tiny subset of [[https://github.com/eclipse/gef-legacy/tree/master/org.eclipse.draw2d][Eclipse draw2d classes]] (altered to remove any [[https://www.eclipse.org/swt/][SWT]] dependency).

The only "real" custom class added is =RRouter=: it's called =RRouter= because the name is good.

* How is this used?  

This is currently used for custom drawing via [[https://github.com/archimatetool/archi-scripting-plugin][jArchi]] scripts ([[https://github.com/yveszoundi/archi-humaneimage][Humane Image scripts]]). For general purposes, it's probably better to integrate Eclipse draw2d [[https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.eclipse/draw2d][directly]] in your projects.

* What are the Requirements?

- A Java development kit installed ([[https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/install/overview-jdk-installation.html][JDK 7+]])
- [[https://maven.apache.org/][Apache Maven]] for the build

* How to build it?

It is built using standard Apache Maven commands at the root of the project.

#+begin_src shell
mvn package
#+end_src

A fat jar will be created at =target/edraw2d.lib.jar=, relative to the project root folder.
